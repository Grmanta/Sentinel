# 🛡️ Sentinel - TARA UI Tool

**Status:** In Design Phase  

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

Design and implement a modern, intuitive desktop application to assist with **TARA (Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment)** in the automotive cybersecurity domain (ISO 21434).

The application allows users to **visually create embedded system architectures** using predefined components (UDS, JTAG ports, HSM, etc.) and automatically generates a **preliminary risk analysis**.

It aims to simplify the TARA process with a cleaner interface than legacy tools like Medini, and supports further expert validation and iteration.

## 💡 Why this project?

As an automotive cybersecurity architect, I'm transitioning towards **modern C++/Qt software development**.

This project serves both as:
- A **technical learning journey** (C++, Qt, architecture, tooling)
- A **prototype** of a practical tool for real-world TARA analysts
